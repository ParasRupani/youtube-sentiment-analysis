good morning everybody I'm Johanna Bella I'm the manager of the
science education program and I'm happy to welcome you to the science on Saturday this morning which is brought
to you in collaboration with the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District so how many of you in the
audience have come to science on Saturday before this month oh that is awesome well welcome back and before we
get started I'm gonna go through my little introduction remember that if
need be if we have an emergency please follow all the ushers instructions let's
take a moment to silence our cellphones so we can give the presentation our full attention and please when we're done
with the presentation would you please stay in your seats for the Q&A so that everybody can hear the questions and
everybody can continue the learning process as our presenters answer the
questions you may have after listening to them so this year's presentation as
you already know women in stem science technology engineering and mathematics and we've talked about science and we've
talked about technology and we've talked about engineering so we must be at map and today we're gonna talk about
statistics in the world around us and we're gonna have a fabulous presentation our first presenter is dr. Anna kress
Ian who is the statistician at the laboratory she runs the group for applied statistics at the lab and she's
been at Livermore since 2009 she works on a variety of projects using her
statistical skills everything from stockpile stewardship to climate change which you'll hear about today and she
received her PhD from the University of Arizona mr. Richard Newton is right from
over the hill at Tracy high school he teaches math and computer science he got
his degree in an economics from UC Davis and he is the chairperson of the math
department currently so without further ado I'd like to introduce dr. Curtis Ian
and mr. Newton thank you
good morning everybody I'm here to help Ana talk about statistics in science I
hope that the talk is really engaging and I'm really excited to have you guys learn about where math can be applied
and in which ways to a variety of fields and without any further ado I'll turn it over to Hannah thank you thank you I'm
an occupation in enema applied statistician at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and if you don't know what
that means you will at the end of this talk it's great seeing you on Saturday
morning showing up for science and Saturday lecturing and we'll be talking about basketball medicine climate and
we'll see how statistics helps us understand everything around us and Richard is going to join us as Rana said
Outline
this is the fourth lecture in the stem series where M stands for mathematics and we'll be talking about mathematics
of chance in other words probability and statistics through some episodes from
history of statistics we'll see how statistics improves our understanding of the world in our lives so how many of
you have seen science technology and engineering lectures in the past three
Saturdays so what do you think
livermorium I chipped and National Ignition projects have in common they
they collect data they collect data and
they have to do data analysis to show discovery of a short-lived element
livermorium they have to do data analysis to study response of a human in
What is common?
a box to a particular drug treatment or they have to analyze data on already
conducted NIT shots to inform what future shots they have to do in order to
produce more energy and ultimately create a small star on earth you can ask
how do they do this and the methods of data analysis have their roots in
statistics probability and mathematics statistical methods help us analyze data
and to learn about the world around us we humans we've been curious about the
Early data collection: Egyptian census
world including other humans beings since day one collecting data and
summarizing them with numbers has been our way of describing and explaining a
world around us the practice of conducting census began in Egypt in the
second millennium BC they used census data for tax gathering and to determine
fitness for military purposes this collection of data for tax and military
continued in many countries around the world to present times census in general
means collecting data about every individual person or object in contrast
to the census data are those data collected by measuring apparatus at selected locations in times for example
imagine measuring temperature we cannot measure everywhere all the time
this was specially not possible in the 17th century when they'd are collected
across large geographical regions long time periods it's important to keep
procedures and records consistent otherwise individual researchers might
create records that are difficult to compare and reconcile the first
prescription on how to collect data and standardized weather measurements was
How to collect data?
given by Robert Hooke in 1663 this was
one of early examples of statistics in public administration it defines and
standard for how data should be collected while data analysis is the
first thing we think of as a statistical goal data collection is equally
important the earliest set of actual instrumental measurements of temperature date back to
medici Network in 17th century these data were recorded every few hours at 11
Temperature measurements date back to 17th century
different locations in Europe mostly through Italy using identical
thermometers even then people recognized that weather can change within a day and
the measurements need to be taken several times a day but in addition that
they recognized that there might be something we call today measurement
error by the 18th century the term statistics meant systematic collection
of demographic and economic data in the early 19th century the collection of
data intensified and the meaning of statistics broadened to include all three disciplines data collection data
What is statistics?
summarization and data analysis of course in those days there were no
computers or calculators so data summarization was done by paper and
pencil a pie chart a form of graphical representation of data that we take for
granted these days was first developed in 1801 in 1834 the Royal statistical
Society was established in London the members call themselves status
World's first Statistical Societies
--tz-- it's a word we don't use often these days and their original aim was
procuring arranging and publishing facts to illustrate the conditions and
prospects of society the American Statistical Association the main
professional organization of the decisions in the United States was established just five years later and
it's the second oldest continuously operating professional Society in the
United States 477 years the Association has been a close affiliate of the US
government and the work statistical work that is done in the government in particular in Census Bureau Department
of Labor and Food and Drug and Drug Administration the first woman to be an
elected fellow of the Royal statistical Society was Florence Nightingale
Florence Nightingale
Florence 19 it was founder of modern nursing statistician and English social
reformer she was born in 1822 wealthy English parents who discouraged her from
pursuing the nursing profession these periods are often known as Dark Ages of
Nursing when nurses were unskilled and hospitals were mainly places to die so
it's not difficult to see why her parents discouraged come from suing the profession
Florence loved mathematics from an early age and became a pioneer in visual presentation and information and
statistical graphics Florence became famous for her work during the Crimean
War from 1854 to 1856 responding to
unpopular newspaper reports on horrendous situation in the English work
and hospitals the Secretary of War agreed to let her organize a group
female nurses and to go to the war camp in November of 1854 nineteen gale and
thirty eight nurses arrived to the British camp the doctors originally did
not welcome the female nurses but at the number of patients escalated their help
was needed and they made a difference and therefore in this leadership the
nurses brought hygiene sanitation nutrition and comfort to patients her
group of nurses transformed the hospital into healthy environment within six
months and that resulted in the death rates of patients to drop from 40
percent to 219 Gail is credited with a
development of a form of a pie chart that we called these days nineteen girls
rose diagram this is the this is a picture of a rose diagram from Florence
Nightingale's rose diagram
nineteen girls report that she presented to the members of British Parliament on the nature and magnitude of the
conditions of medical during the Crimean
War now if you look at the blue circles the Rose diagram on the left and the
rose diagram on the right they're on the same scale and the area colored grey
represents the deaths from preventable causes the diagram on the right consent
Starr it starts with April of 1854 and glows goes clockwise there are 12 slices
on the diagram and each slice stands for one month and each slide shows number of
deaths for that month they're colored by causes of death and you see that the
gray area is the largest so the majority of the deaths are preventable and you
mostly to lack of hygiene medications and food Florence and her nurses arrived
to the camp in November of 1854 and start implementing changes to the nursing
practice six months later the mortality rate drops to two percent we see this on
the diagram on the left so 19 years statistical data analysis strongly
influenced the findings of the Commission investigating the health in the British Army and resulted in greater
public health advances Nanta Gayle was described as a true pioneer in the
graphical representation of statistics the kind of data that Florence collected
in military hospitals we refer to as observational data in contrast to
observational data are the data collecting from experimental studies in
the 20th century statistics began to be used in pharmaceutical testing when a
new drug is introduced the question that needs to be addressed is does it work more precisely how effective is the new
Experimental Design
drug in treating certain medical condition we want drugs to be effective
for a large population but it's not possible to test them on the entire population so the question becomes how
should an experiment be designed to test the effectiveness of a drug
statisticians established a procedure called randomized controlled experiments
first the subjects are selected to represent the population of interest
How effective is a new medicine?
then the subjects are randomly assigned to two groups the treatment group and
the control group the treatment group is then given a new medication or treatment
while the control group doesn't receive the actual medicine but a placebo
statisticians then use a method of comparison to compare the effect of the
drug the reasoning is if the control is comparable to the
treatment group apart from the treatment then the difference in the response of
the two groups is likely to do to be to the effect of the treatment the random
assignment of subjects is used to make sure that the treatment group is like the control group in a double-blind
experiment subjects do not know whether they are in the treatment or in the control group neither to do those who
evaluate those responses these guards against bias both in the response in in
the evaluation when the response of the two groups are compared the question becomes is the difference between the
two groups due to chance or something else just as important is the question
if there is a difference between these two groups what is the chance that we see it the decisions have invented tests
of significance to deal with these sorts of questions the reasoning behind tests
Probability
of significance relies on understanding of probability probability is part of
mathematics that studies questions about chance and events happening people talk
loosely about chance all the time what is a chance of getting a job
what is the chance I need Steven Steve Curren on a street today or what is the
chance of rain tomorrow but for scientific purpose it is necessary to
give the word chance a definite and clear definition this turns out to be
hard and mathematicians have struggled with this for centuries the doctrine of
chance was the first textbook in probability and it was written by 18th
century French mathematician the more moral rod of the chance of something as
a percentage of time it is expected to happen when the basic
process is done over and over again independently and under the same
assumptions so if we flip a coin many
times half of the tosses will result in heads half of the tosses will result in
tails if something is impossible it happens 0 percent of the time so if we
were to roll two dice and add the numbers could we get 14 no because on
each of them the largest number is 6 so the largest number we can come up with on 2 is 12 so that's an example of
impossible invent getting 14 on the other hand if something is sure to
happen like the Sun rises tomorrow then it happens hundred percent of the time
testing the effectiveness of a new drug was just one of in examples of statistical reasoning being used in
public administration there are many more and with the emphasis on learning
from data and making better predictions that the stations have been working in
government business science and even sports and I'll turn to Richard now to
tell you how statistics is used in basketball
thank you Anna so it's a really exciting time in basketball right now because
data data analytics and statistics are transforming the way the way the game is looked at and how it's being played and
the reason for that is because up above each basketball quarter are now six
cameras which were recording the movement of all players in three-dimensional space and from that
Basketball player tracking
data you can you can generate hundreds of thousands of data points because you have five players per team as well as
the basketball that represents eleven actors across about five thousand square feet of force floor space for 48 minutes
so with that data we can now start asking more advanced questions than we
could previously previously we only had a box score which represented about five statistics rebounds assists points
steals and blocks so what I like to call this as high resolution data the problem
then becomes how do you take that high resolution data and then take it and answer questions with it so we're gonna
go to YouTube and we've got a video clip that help explains how the Golden State Warriors are using data to transform the
way they look at the game of basketball the Warriors are the top seed in the NBA
playoffs but their success is predicated on much more than Jukes and jumpers they
rely just as heavily on tracking and technology we have a sport view cameras by stats and here six of them
strategically mounted high above the Oracle Court basically allows us to map out the game and a three-dimensional
everything everything from player positioning and ball movement to shot charts and tendencies the data and its
applications seemingly limitless we've got data from every single game during NBA season we
kind of do whatever we want with that data and manipulate in a way that that makes sense and we can ask the questions
and get answers stuff that's a shot one enter Sammy gelfand affectionately known as crunch of the
wizard a lot of different nicknames of thing on the day his official title is coordinator of basketball analytics his
job to take the mouths of sports view data use it to formulate the right questions help answer those questions
and disseminate the information to coaches and players I'll go to him and ask him for maybe a certain stat that
I'm looking for or maybe something I'm seeing on the floor and I'll ask him if there's a stat that he has that can
either support or deny the argument you have been there the field down you don't just take a bunch of data and like
picking a needle out of a haystack when you watch the games things will pop out sometimes they'll get answers that we
can make decisions from sometimes we want those decisions might be as minor as which direction to force an opposing
ball handler or as major as which player might add the most value to the organization especially when it comes to
defensive metrics that are harder to quantify from traditional statistics I mean taught a couple times that was the
main reason why I traded for me was to try that defense they missed it a lot of time and resources he's researching that
I knew though researching me a month before the trade deadline so what I really like about that video is it
highlights how they're taking the data but it takes a statistician to analyze that data to inform decision making and
they use those decisions to guide what's happening on the floor during a game to plan for a game or even in the middle of
a game to maybe change at halftime the approach that they're using on the fly
additionally they use that information too large to guide the decision making process of the organization in terms of
which players they want to acquire maybe which players they need to get rid of and so we have another video which I
think is really interesting because it demonstrates that if you consider the Golden State Warriors organization it's
probably worth about two billion dollars or more today and so these decisions are
incredibly important from an economic standpoint so this next clip is actually the Golden State Warriors CEO or general
manager basketball operations explaining how they're using analytics and statistics to guide their
decision-making process at the highest levels
basketball it's not just about our customers okay big big data is affecting the game on
the court and how we gain a competitive edge technology is increasingly making
an impact on the basketball court gone are the days of assistant coaches discounting points and rebounds and
assists today it's about efficiency in the amount of time I'm given on the court how efficient am I in scoring
points what combinations of players playing together perform best in each
games situation is a play more effective when a star player catches the ball and shoots immediately or dribbles twice and
then shoots or drives to the basket the Warriors were really one of the first teams to deploy the most advanced
product available to get objective answers to these questions through analytics up in the rafters of Oracle
Arena six cameras are deployed to capture every movement of every player on the court we're going to show you a
video that we've slowed down a little bit to make it easier for you to watch as you can see each of these players is
identified with his jersey number one teams in yellow the other in red the red circle follows the ball each players
position is tracked as activity recorded each dribble each pass each shot then we
have a 3d map of every player and every combination of players sharing the court
at the same time we can actually at this point analyze how the offense develops
each play and how the defense defends the basket represented here by the the
blue and yellow now hundreds of thousands of data points are represented and then they're organized into reports
that our coaching staff can use to improve team important team performance and we're really just scratching the
surface at this intersection of technology and the game itself I really
like how he concludes there I also like how he's taking the data and they show the mathematical or physical model that
they're that they're generating but what he says at the end is really powerful that we're really just scratching the surface of the intersection of the
technology and the game of basketball because we're able to now gather all this data but what do we do with it and
what decisions can we Jenner and I want to show you how it's changing the nature of the game in a couple quick
steps so if we look at this first slide here what you can see is when the
The 3-point shot upward trend
three-point line was entered into the NBA in 1979 very few taint very few
teams took three-point shots you can see the graph represents the number of times a team attempted a three-point shot per
game on average so in a particular season in 1979 teams only tried three
three-point shots per game which is extremely low today they're taking 22
shots per team per games so there's been an increase by a factor of about seven we can actually see right here
they shortened the three-point line during a couple of seasons and teams took more shots but if we were to
account for that aberration of the data we would see a strong linear trend so the decision is being made to take more
three-point shots and the question would be why are they making that decision and then it's also influencing the behavior
not just of the teams as entities but as the individual players so on this next
slide what we're gonna see is anyone that's been listening to the to the news these days is probably hearing that
Who gets the most 3 point shots?
Stefan curry is extremely close to breaking the record in number of threes made per season we can see that record
being beaten here in two consecutive seasons so let me explain what the graph is demonstrating in the blue you can see
Jones in 2005 set the record for most threes in a season with 225 and the
graph is showing from the first game of the season to the final game of the season so if we're going across the
games across the x-axis and we can see sometimes he was making more and then
sometimes his rate slowed down but he ended up at 225 last season Steph Curry broke the record with 286 so we can see
the growth over the course of the season in his number of shots made the yellow
represents his pace as of this season as of a few weeks ago he's actually about
to break the record in a couple of games he's just short of 286 so the question
can become then where is he gonna go moving forward we've taken the data we've we've
collected it we've analyzed it we've summarized it graphically but now we can use it to make a prediction
how many three-point shots is Stefan Curie actually going to make this season and so various people are trying to
guess how many he's going to make and so if you make an approximation or a prediction of let's say four hundred and
three three points made at the end of the season that wouldn't be a very good prediction because it's so specific
all right so instead of making an extremely specific prediction I could do something like this and I could have a
cone of variability in my prediction stating that at the end of the season
ice I think that he's going to have somewhere between say 380 shots made and
430 shots made all right this is powerful because this is not a form of
weakness in my argument and a lot of people see mathematical uncertainty in that way instead of being a weak
argument it's actually now a strong argument because if I said he's going to make four hundred and three shots my
likelihood of being inaccurate is extremely high if I give a cone of variability in my prediction I have a
very strong prediction that's gonna be more accurate more fire percent of the time so I can be more confident in that
prediction so the decision-making process is changing over the course of a
season but how does that affect an individual shot being made and that's another question that we could look at this next slide is purposefully
overwhelming all right so this represents all of his shots from every
region of the floor up until now in the season so there's various regions represented and I'm gonna highlight one
so we can see up until now in the season he's taken 270 shots from this particular region of the floor and made
163 of them giving him an accuracy rate of 60% from that space whereas this is
his worst spot on the floor he's taken 16 shots and only made six of them so he's 38% from that region there so I can
take this information which is maybe too much to look at broadly and narrow down
the scope of my question by doing something like this if I look only at the difference between making an easy shot close to the
basket where he's 60% accurate and I summed up all the shots from the beyond
the three-point arc and he's made 222 out of 488 shots we can see that he's
45% accurate from far away and 60% accurate from close to the basket but
it's still not answering questions on his decision-making I know now that he's less accurate from far away but that
seems like an obvious answer so we could break down the question a little bit further and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna change it to have a like denominator because right now it's confusing he's taking more shots from far away than close up so if I change it
to having a denominator of a hundred now I can see were he to take a hundred
shots from close to the basket I would expect him to make sixty of those shots so that represents my ratio of 60%
whereas if he took a hundred shots from far away I would expect him to make 45 all right but at the title of the slide
it says that we are generating expected points not expected ratio of makes two
misses so we know that he makes more points if he's further away so the analysis I'm doing leads to this
conclusion in terms of points were he to take a hundred shots from far away he
would make it expectedly 45 of them according to my ratio and he
would get three points per shot giving me 135 overall points whereas if I gave him the ball and he shot it from close
up a hundred times I would expect him to earn 120 points well now it looks much more clear in guiding my decision should
I take a two-point shot or a three-point shot and it seems from this graphic that I should be going for the three-point
shot so this guy's my decision-making process and giving the expected points per possession when Stefan curry is
holding the ball given he has the choice but that's not the whole story
all right this is a expected points value breakdown and really there's a
Expected points vary by location
nature of probability that's going to go into whether he makes four misses those shots so what we've done now is we've
taken that information and we've put it into a simulation and I've broken the
simulation down into two worlds on the left side of the world you can see the pink Stefan curry he's behind the
three-point line and he's going to attempt a three-point shot so he's got a 40 five percent chance to make the shot and
if he makes it he gets three points the Stefan Curry on the right in purple is gonna attempt a two-point shot which we
know he has a 60% chance to make and he'll earn two points we're gonna give each step in Curry ten shots and he'll
either make them or miss them so on the left if he takes ten three-point shots he could earn anywhere
between 0 and 30 points and on the right he could earn anywhere from 0 to 20
points so I'm gonna have a student volunteer of mine come out and help me this is Bella all right I'm gonna let
Bella actually pick if she wants so Bella you can come on over here so do
you want to attempt the three-point side or the two-point side you're gonna go for the 3-point side all right so you
can take the chair on the left so before we engage in the simulation I want everyone to make a prediction all right given ten shots for each stuff
in curry which one do you think is going to earn more points so if you think the
Stefan curry on the left the three-point shooting stuff and curry is going to earn more points raise your left hand and if you think it's the one that's
taking the two point shots raise your right hand okay
all right Saul it I'll let Bela shoot first it will wait Bela just one sec while they get it going on the big
screen how cool so she took her first shot and you can see I didn't make it
I took mine didn't make a shot
oh I'm gonna take trouble tied it up
all right looks like I'm in the lead oh there we go Oh
yep that's it so ten shots so it looks like the two points I'd won so just raise your hand really quick if you got
the right prediction all right so that kind of contradicts what we had previously learned which is really
interesting and what's really nice about computing is I can now do something like this that was rather slow so what I've
done is I set up the computer to run a thousand trials of this experiment so there's gonna be 20 shots because 10
shots per player times a thousand is 20,000 shots which is about as many three-point shots that have been taken
this last month in the NBA to think about a scale there and I'll just run the simulation and there we go so that
was 20,000 shots and we can see while in our single trial the two-point shooter
won in the long term and the very long term liked and has been talking about we would actually expect the 3-point
shooter to win more frequently and there are some ties so hopefully that clarifies the idea of expected value and
the nature of probability and how additionally simulation can be extremely powerful in guiding the decision-making
process so if everyone can give Bella a nice big round of applause that'd be great
Thank You Bella alright and with that
I'm going to turn it back over to Anna so she can show you how Big Data diet decides her decision-making process in
the field that she works in thank you so
it looks like there is a lot of data generating in basketball when the spatial position of each player and the
ball attract over time however their natural phenomena that generate much
larger data sets can you think of one
for example the earth climate scientists
study our enormous lee complex planet and the employee statistical reasoning to make sense of the data if you want to
learn more about climate science research you can find several lectures given in the science and Saturday series
by climate scientists I'm a statistician so today we'll talk about climate from
data perspective we'll talk about uncertainties and uncertainly it doesn't
mean we don't know anything it doesn't mean that science is not reliable on the contrary to a scientist
statistically calculated uncertainty is a form of knowledge and explains how
well something is known people often think that weather and climate are the
same but they are not right the weather
Weather vs Climate
is the state of the atmosphere around us and we can measure it with Mal instruments we can measure temperature
pressure humidity precipitation the picture on the left shows weather
conditions in Livermore yesterday the picture on the right could represent
climate in Livermore in February sometimes it's cold sometimes it's hot
but more often it's between weather happens
they today and in shorter climate is weather over a long period of time there
is an old saying climate is what you expect and weather is what you get we
can think of climate as the probability or chance of different types of weather
occurring climate change is change in the typical or average weather for
example increased average temperature may mean many hot many more hot days and
Change in climate
slightly fewer cold days now if you are
flipping a coin to see if it's fair you need to flip it for a long time because
before you can be sure in the same way we need decades odd weather records to
make statement about climate to study climate and detects change we need
Collecting data about Earth
observational data with advances in technology which can collect data from
beat Austrians to atmosphere for example some NASA satellites and instruments
observe Earth's land air ice water others monitor the Sun and the amount of
energy coming from the Sun they are all important for understanding how climate
works from scientific view we need to
survey all the data not just temperature records from the surface or from space
but also data from deep oceans Arctic sea ice land-based glaciers Greenland
and so on there are many the very difficult problems that's the decisions
work together with climate scientists one of them is that observational data from different measurement platforms
often represent climate processes at very different spatial and temporal
scales a lot scientists and statisticians are
involved in research that studies how to best to cope what is the best way to
combine the data that come from different sources how to identify and adjust for differences in measurement
systems and how to deal with change in spatial and temporal coverage of
measurements this is the map of observed surface temperature change from 1901 to
Observed changes in surface temperature from 1901 to 2012
2012 this map was derived from temperature trends determined by a
statistical method called linear regression one of the challenges we face
is that in early 20th century we don't have observations from many parts of the
world those areas are white on the map you see on the map that the air
temperature over land changes more because the change in temperature over
land happens much more rapidly than the change over ocean over parts of the
ocean you see that the change is around half of a degree Celsius while over land
you see regions colored in purple with the change of two degrees Celsius many
aspects of climate are showing evidence of change here is a graph that shows increase in global land surface
temperature from 1850 to present time each curve represents independently
estimated change and while the all these curves are not the same they don't
Many aspects of climate are showing evidence of change
completely agree we see that there is upward trend in all of them the sea
scene were upward trends in the global sea surface temperature on this graph
they are five independently derived estimates of sea surface temperature
we like to have many little Earth's to play with and collect data we don't have
them so we need computer models to simulate the earth climate models are
computer programs need mathematical equations the heart of a climate models
Climate Models are based in physics
are the basic laws of physics like Newton's law of motion climate models
use mathematical equations to describe the havior of various back factors of
the Earth's system that impact climate these equations describe sun's energy
dynamics of the atmosphere ocean land surface living things in ice
the models are programmed to simulate condition over hundreds of years as
accurately as possible to solve all these mathematical equations we need
supercomputers and here at Lawrence Livermore National Lab we are fortunate that at any given time we have the
fastest and the biggest computer supercomputer in the world now remember
Climate models require high performance computing
we said that when we talked about sampling from the population we said that we cannot test every possible
subject similarly when running simulation experiments on earth there
are too many different experiments we can try even for a supercomputer so the
question is how do we choose ones to run this is where the decisions come in to
help to help select the most useful simulation to run those that will give
us the more the most information about the questions we are interested in
climate change is caused by change in energy balance there is more energy
coming in into the system than coming out and the planet is storing it up the
extra energy means that the temperature is increasing on this graph we see
increase in the observed temperature shown in the back curve the question that we can ask
ourselves now is is this increased due to nature alone well we have climate
models and we can run computer experiments so the red curve shows what
our computer model tells us if we assume that there is no human factor
influencing the climate actually this graph shows temperatures from many such
simulations in gray and yellow and you
see that none of these simulations agree with the observational data and remember
we run all these simulations and their assumptions no human factor influences the climate therefore warning cannot be
Warming not explained by nature alone
explained by nature alone what if we change the simulation to include human
Human effects on climate change
behavior if we took if you look at
simulations that take carbon dioxide and other human factors now we see that the
simulations are pretty close to the observed temperatures so the fingerprint
of human activity is relevant to the magnitude and patterns of the observed climate change the question is how fast
will the warming be and what happens to the right of this graph what happens
past 200 2010 here we see possible
Prediction with uncertainties
future trends of temperature in red we see what simulations predict if we
continued greenhouse emissions at the current rate in blue the simulation
assumes that we'll go green each of these predictions has its own cone of
variability in fact we don't know with certainty how humans are going to behave
in the future so we have to consider many scenario
what if we continue to produce emissions as we are now what if we manage to
reduce them in the developing nations we are not certain at what rate the world's
population will grow what mix of renewable and fossil fuel will people use in the next 30 years
so assumptions about all these questions influence the prediction of future
climate change I hope that we convinced you that you can apply statistics to
many different areas and that through statistical analysis data have been
telling us fascinating stories through history I'll quote one of my favorites
at the stations the great John Tukey who said once the best thing about being a
statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard that pretty much
sums up why I ended up a statistician I like working with other scientists learning other signs what what they do
and looking at the data even better it's
great time to be a statistician Computers make it possible to do things
Statistics has many applications
with the data that were unimaginable before but they also create so much data
that we need all the statisticians we can get statistics is the ninth fastest
growing occupation and it's likely to be ranked even higher so my plea to you the
next generation is take statistics classes and learn kind of skills needed
to succeed in data centric world this is
the end of my talk thank you all very much for coming today please stay in
your seats and we'll take questions
you
